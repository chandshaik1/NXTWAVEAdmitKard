# Mobile Number Verification Application

## Overview

This is a simple Mobile Number Verification application built using React.js. It allows users to enter their mobile numbers, send OTPs, and verify them. The application consists of two screens: Mobile Number Screen and OTP Verification Screen. 

The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate a basic flow of mobile number verification using React.js. Please note that this is a simplified example and doesn't include actual API calls for OTP generation and verification. Additionally, it lacks extensive styling and validation.
